# frontend-exercise1-HappyCake
Finished my first frontend project named Happy cake, including 2 pages, homepage and one detail page.

In this front web development exercise, the most valuable things I've acquired are about the concept of building a easy maintained webpage and how Adobe Photoshop helps web development.

Before I really started to do some online open source web development project, I went through all the HTML and CSS tutorial on W3Cschool. Each element is illustrated seperately and precisely, but the drawback of W3Cschool is also the point that those elements are not interactive. From my perspective, W3C is extremely helpful if you have already acquired some basic web development knowledge, it's more like a dictionary. 

So what is the frontend web development?

The website’s front end is everything you see and can interact with browser. So, creating this visual part is called front-end development. On the other hand, the back end is everything that happens, well, backstage. It contains servers where your web pages are located and the underlying logic that governs the website’s functions and processes. 

HTML is normally utilised to structure a web document. It defines such elements as headlines or paragraphs and enables embedding images, video, and other media.CSS interacts with HTML elements, the components of a web page.It’s applied to define how HTML elements are supposed to be presented on a webpage in terms of design, layout, and variations for diverse devices with different screen sizes. 

Then how to design a easily maintained webpage?

Developing a webpage is huge project which contains thounds lines of code and many media resources. Naming is the first step, otherwise you will make yourself so confused. As I mentioned above, various HTML elements are involved in a project, some of them should be presented differently, while some of them should be presented identically. So I have to give them specific name to divided them into several groups, and this name should be easily understood and named in Camel-Case style. Secondly, I higly recommend to write a work plan before coding. In web development, some parts will be shared in several pages like navigation bar and the footer. So it will be time saving if you can successfully figure out what will be the public parts. Those public parts can be wrote in a public style file and can be easily accessed by other pages.

Finally, Is Photoshop necessary for web designing?

For some big IT companies, frontend developers don't have to master photoshop because there are some UI designers are responsible for design stuff. Frontend developers will be able to get all statitics. However, I believe Photoshop skills are essential for a web developer. Web design is also a kind of design, not only to achieve some features. A good website should also be an attractive artwrok. It involes icons, graphics, and mockups.

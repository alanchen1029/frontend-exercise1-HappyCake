# frontend-exercise1-HappyCake
finished my first frontend project named Happy cake, including 2 pages, homepage and one detail page.
In this front web development exercise, the most valuable things I've acquired are about the concept of building a easy maintained webpage and how Adobe Photoshop helps web development.
Before I really started to do some online open source web development project, I went through all the HTML and CSS tutorial on W3Cschool. Each element is illustrated seperately and precisely, but the drawback of W3Cschool is also the point that those elements are not interactive. From my perspective, W3C is extremely helpful if you have already acquired some basic web development knowledge, it's more like a dictionary.
